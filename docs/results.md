# Results

## Overview
The analysis produced two key visualizations that illustrate the trends in global average sea level changes over time.

## Figure 1: Overall Analysis
- **Description**: This plot shows the scatter plot of sea level measurements over time, along with the line of best fit for the entire dataset. The line indicates the overall trend in sea level rise from 1880 to the present.
- **Prediction**: The plot includes a projection of the sea level for the year 2050, based on the linear regression model.

## Figure 2: Recent Analysis (From 2000)
- **Description**: This plot focuses on the data from the year 2000 onwards. It includes a scatter plot of the recent sea level measurements and the line of best fit for this subset of data.
- **Insight**: The recent trend provides insights into more recent changes in sea level, showing whether the rate of increase has accelerated or decelerated in recent years.

## Insights
- **Overall Trend**: The data shows a clear upward trend in sea level rise since 1880. The linear regression model suggests a continued increase in sea levels if current trends persist.
- **Recent Trends**: The analysis of data from the year 2000 indicates whether recent changes differ from the historical trend. This can help identify short-term changes or anomalies in sea level rise.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides a visual and quantitative assessment of sea level changes over time. The projections and trends can inform discussions on climate change and sea level rise, contributing to informed decision-making and policy development.
